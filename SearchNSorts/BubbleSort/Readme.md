# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## Introduction

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## How It Works

1. Start from the first element of the list.
2. Compare the current element with the next element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
4. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the list.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all elements, reducing the range of comparison by one each time (since the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position after each pass).
6. If no swaps are made during a pass, the list is considered sorted, and the algorithm stops early.

## Time Complexity

| Case             | Time Complexity | Explanation                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Best Case**    | O(n)            | The best-case occurs when the list is already sorted. The algorithm makes one pass through the list with no swaps, resulting in an early exit.    |
| **Average Case** | O(n^2)          | In the average case, the algorithm needs to compare and potentially swap elements in about half the passes, leading to quadratic time complexity. |
| **Worst Case**   | O(n^2)          | The worst-case occurs when the list is sorted in reverse order. The algorithm must make n-1 passes, each requiring approximately n comparisons.   |

## Space Complexity

| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auxiliary Space** | O(1)             | Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of extra space (only a few additional variables). |

## Use Cases

Bubble Sort is rarely used in practice for large datasets due to its inefficiency compared to other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort. However, it has its place in certain situations:

- **Teaching**: Due to its simplicity, Bubble Sort is often used to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms in computer science education.
- **Small Datasets**: It can be efficient for small datasets where the overhead of more complex algorithms might not be justified.
- **Nearly Sorted Data**: If the list is already or almost sorted, Bubble Sort can perform very efficiently (O(n) in the best case).
- **Memory Constraints**: Since it is an in-place algorithm with O(1) space complexity, Bubble Sort can be useful when memory usage is a critical concern.
